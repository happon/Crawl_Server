      "clean_text": "A fourth wave of the \"GlassWorm\" campaign is targeting macOS developers with malicious VSCode/OpenVSX extensions that deliver trojanized versions of crypto wallet applications.\n\nKoi Security researchers discovered a new GlassWorm campaign that targets macOS systems exclusively, a departure from the previous ones that focused only on Windows.\n\nInstead of the invisible Unicode seen in the first two waves, or compiled Rust binaries used in the third one, the most recent GlassWorm attacks use an AES-256-CBC–encrypted payload embedded in compiled JavaScript in the OpenVSX extensions: studio-velte-distributor.pro-svelte-extension, cudra-production.vsce-prettier-pro, and Puccin-development.full-access-catppuccin-pro-extension.\n\nThe malicious logic executes after a 15-minute delay, likely in an attempt to evade analysis in sandboxed environments.\n\nInstead of PowerShell, it now uses AppleScript, and instead of Registry modification, it uses LaunchAgents for persistence. The Solana blockchain-based command-and-control (C2) mechanism remains unchanged, though, and researchers say that there is also infrastructure overlap.\n\nApart from targeting over 50 browser crypto extensions, developer credentials (GitHub, NPM), and browser data, GlassWorm now also attempts to steal Keychain passwords.\n\nAdditionally, it now features a new capability where it checks for hardware cryptocurrency wallet apps like Ledger Live and Trezor Suite on the host, and replaces them with a trojanized version. However, Koi Security notes that this mechanism is currently failing because the trojanized wallets are returning empty files. This suggests the attacker is still preparing the macOS wallet trojans or the infrastructure is in transition, though all other malicious functionality remains fully operational.\n\nDevelopers who have installed any of the three extensions are recommended to remove them immediately, reset their GitHub account passwords, revoke their NPM tokens, check their system for signs of infection, or reinstall it.",
