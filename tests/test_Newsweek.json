Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nSunday's FIFA Club World Cup Final features two of the biggest clubs in the world in terms of budget and star power.\n\nBut as we'll detail below, oddsmakers see PSG as massive favorites over Chelsea on Sunday afternoon at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, NJ.\n\nGiven the run PSG is on under Manager Luis Enrique, its status as the betting favorite in this match makes sense, to some extent. But are oddsmakers overlooking Chelsea by listing them at longer than 2-to-1 odds to raise the trophy?\n\nAt its best, PSG is certainly dominant, and it doesn't help Chelsea's chances that they could be missing multiple key players.\n\nFor as impressive as PSG have been in recent months, though -- including in their dominant CWC semifinal win overReal Madrid-- we saw in their group stage loss to Botafogo and in their hard-fought quarterfinal win over Bayern Munich that they're not necessarily untouchable.\n\nBelow are the odds from three top sportsbooks in the two most popular markets for soccer matches: three-way moneyline and match winner.\n\nThe DraftKings, FanDuel and bet365 three-way moneyline odds below apply to this afternoon's result after 90 minutes, plus stoppage time.\n\nSportsbooks also offer each team's odds to be crowned Club World Cup champion.\n\nIn this market, it doesn't matter whether the winner comes out on top in 90 minutes, extras or PKs; all that matters is who moves on.\n\nIn terms of budget, for what that's worth, these teams are on relatively equal footing. It's Chelsea, in fact, who have the higher squad value,per Transfermarkt(Chelsea: 1.26 billion euros, PSG: 1.12 billion euros).\n\nBut in the last few months, no one has looked capable of beating PSG at its best.\n\nIt's especially hard to imagine Chelsea pulling off this upset after it played five of its six matches in this competition against opponents outside Europe. Chelsea could only beat the teams it drew on its side of the bracket, but the quality of competition on Sunday will take a massive leap from the quarterfinal and semifinal contests against Brazilian clubs Palmeiras and Fluminense.\n\nPSG, on the other hand, has outscored its Club World Cup opposition 16-to-1. At this point, it's also clear that this club did not take Botafogo seriously in a shocking 1-0 loss back in group play.\n\nAgainst quality competition including Atletico Madrid in group play (PSG 4, Atleti 0), Bayern Munich in the quarterfinals (PSG 2, Bayern 0) and Real Madrid in the semis (PSG 4, RM 0), this young PSG team has looked like a potential dynasty.\n\nForward Ousmane Dembele, right back Achraf Hakimi, midfielder Fabian Ruiz, center back Marquinhos and keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma are all proven veterans, but this lineup also features a number of young stars.\n\nBetween forwards Khvicha Kvaratskhelia (24), Desire Doue (20) and Bradley Barcola (22) and standout midfielders Vitinha (25) and Joao Neves (20), PSG have a chance to remain dominant for years to come.\n\nChelsea has plenty of promising young talent of its own, including Cole Palmer up top, Enzo Fernandez and Moises Caicedo in the midfield and Levi Colwill at center back, but this team is yet to put it all together under Manager Enzo Maresca, who was hired last summer.\n\nPSG are without starting center back Willian Pacho and backup defender Lucas Hernandez. Both remain suspended after being issued red cards in their team's quarterfinal win over Bayern Munich.\n\nIf the semifinal blowout of Real Madrid was anything to go by, the PSG back line featuring 21-year-old Lucas Beraldo in place of Pacho will hardly be a glaring weakness.\n\nFor Chelsea, right back Reece James missed the CWC quarterfinal win over Palmeiras and came off the bench in the semifinal clash with Fluminense, but is expected to be fit for Sunday's final.\n\nThe other injury concern for Chelsea is midfielder Moises Caicedo, who is dealing with an ankle injury. James will most likely start this one, but I'm not convinced Maresca will risk starting Caicedo in the midfield. If he does opt to bring Caicedo off the bench, expect 21-year-old Andrey Santos to start in Caicedo's place.\n\nPSG Expected Lineup: Donnarumma; Hakimi, Marquinhos, Beraldo, Nuno Mendes; Joao Neves, Vitinha, Fabián Ruiz; Dembélé, Doué, Kvaratskhelia.\n\nChelsea Expected Lineup: Sanchez; James, Chalobah, Colwill, Cucurella; Santos, Fernandez; Neto, Palmer, Joao Pedro; Delap\n\nWith Caicedo and Romeo Lavia at full strength next to Fernandez in the midfield, Chelsea would likely have a chance of going toe-to-toe with the PSG trio of Ruiz, Vitinha and Neves.\n\nBut whether it's a somewhat hobbled Lavia or Santos alongside Fernandez, I expect the PSG midfield to dominate once again after overwhelming the Madrid trio of Arda Guler, Aurélien Tchouaméni and Jude Bellingham.\n\nI don't necessarily expect PSG to score as early and often against Chelsea as it did in the semis, when it jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the first 25 minutes.\n\nI can't quite disagree with the oddsmakers on this one being all PSG, though.\n\nThe safe way to bet this one is to take Paris Saint Germain to lead at both halftime and the full-time whistle, which is available at plus-money at DraftKings.\n\nFor a bigger swing, consider a small play on PSG to score more than 2.5 goals in 90 minutes at 2-to-1 odds.\n\nThis team's haul of 10 goals (by six different players) in three knockout games in this tournament is staggering, but there has been nothing fluky about it.\n\nPerFotMob, PSG piled up 7 big chances and 2.91 xG vs. Inter Miami; 5 big chances and 1.98 xG vs. Bayern Munich; and 5 big chances and 2.54 xG vs. Real Madrid.\n\nBest bets:\n\nNewsweek may earn an affiliate commission if you sign up through the links in this article.
